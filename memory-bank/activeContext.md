## Recent Changes

**Multi-Oscillator Volume Control Implementation (October 27, 2025 - Latest):**
- **Achievement:** Implemented per-oscillator volume control with intelligent mixing!
- **Architecture:** 3 oscillators with independent volume levels
  - Oscillator 1 (SINE): 100% volume (full)
  - Oscillator 2 (SQUARE, -1 octave): 60% volume (quieter sub-bass)
  - Oscillator 3 (OFF): 40% volume (quietest when enabled)
- **Implementation:**
  - Added volume member variable (float, 0.0-1.0) to Oscillator class

  - Each oscillator scales its own output independently
- **Mixing Strategy:** Simple averaging with automatic clipping prevention
  - Sum all active oscillator samples (after volume scaling)
  - Divide by number of active oscillators
  - No complex normalization needed - math guarantees no clipping
  - Example: Max possible = (32767 + 19660 + 13107) / 3 = 21,845 (well within ¬±32768 range)
- **Benefits:**
  - Modular design - each oscillator self-contained
  - Runtime adjustable - setVolume() can be called anytime
  - Perfect for presets - combine waveform + volume changes
  - Thread-safe - simple atomic writes
  - Maintains consistent loudness regardless of oscillator count
- **Results:**

**Multiple Waveform Implementation (October 27, 2025):**
- **Achievement:** Expanded oscillator to support 4 distinct waveform types!
- **Waveforms Implemented:**
  - **Square**: Hollow, buzzy, only odd harmonics (original)
  - **Sine**: Pure, smooth, no harmonics - 256-entry LUT in PROGMEM (512 bytes Flash)
  - **Triangle**: Mellow, flute-like, weak odd harmonics - mathematical generation

- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Compiles successfully, no errors/warnings

**DAC Format Fix - Distortion Elimination (October 27, 2025):**
- **Problem:** Distortion across all waveforms due to sample format mismatch
- **Root Cause:** ESP32 built-in DAC expects unsigned 8-bit (0-255), code was sending signed 16-bit (-32768 to 32767)
- **Solution:** Proper sample format conversion in AudioEngine.generateAudioBuffer()
  - Convert signed 16-bit to unsigned 8-bit: `(sample >> 8) + 128`

  - Near volume sensor (50mm) = 0% volume (quiet)
  - Far from volume sensor (400mm) = 100% volume (loud)
- **Files Modified:**
  - src/Theremin.cpp: Swapped map() output values (0 and 100) with explanatory comment
- **Results:** ‚úÖ Volume control now matches classic theremin behavior
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Compiles successfully, behavior correct

**OTA Preprocessor Fix (October 27, 2025):**
- **Problem:** OTA initialized even when `-DENABLE_OTA=0` was set
- **Root Cause:** `#ifdef ENABLE_OTA` checks if defined (any value), not if true/false
- **Solution:** Changed all `#ifdef ENABLE_OTA` to `#if ENABLE_OTA` in main.cpp
- **Results:**
  - ‚úÖ OTA can be enabled/disabled via build flag value
  - ‚úÖ `-DENABLE_OTA=1` enables OTA
  - ‚úÖ `-DENABLE_OTA=0` disables OTA
- **Files Modified:**
  - src/main.cpp: Changed preprocessor directives
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Compiles successfully, OTA enable/disable working correctly

- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Compiles successfully, no errors/warnings

**Pitch Smoothing Improvements (October 27, 2025):**
- **Problem:** Audible pitch stepping from sensor quantization (1mm = ~1.9 Hz jumps)
- **Solution:** Exponential smoothing + floating-point frequency mapping
- **Implementation:**
  - Replaced 5-sample moving average with EWMA (Exponential Weighted Moving Average)
  - Set SMOOTHING_ALPHA = 0.3 for balanced responsiveness/smoothness
  - Added floating-point mapFloat() function in Theremin class
  - Frequency calculation uses float throughout, only casts to int at final step
- **Results:**
  - ‚úÖ 65ms latency reduction (100ms ‚Üí 35ms smoothing lag)
  - ‚úÖ Sub-Hz frequency precision (eliminates integer map() quantization)
  - ‚úÖ More responsive than moving average
  - ‚úÖ Reduced RAM usage (removed circular buffer arrays)

- **Results:**
  - ‚úÖ Smooth, continuous audio with zero gaps
  - ‚úÖ RAM improved to 14.5% (47,584 bytes)
  - ‚úÖ Flash: 65.4% (856,877 bytes)
  - ‚úÖ Volume control works correctly
- **Documentation:** Created CONTINUOUS_AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- **Minor Issue:** Pitch stepping from sensor quantization (1mm = ~1.9 Hz)

## Active Decisions

### Phase 1 Design Choices (Current)
1. **Sensor Selection:** VL53L0X Time-of-Flight sensors
   - Reason: High precision (¬±3%), no interference, fast reading (<30ms)
   - Trade-off: More expensive than ultrasonic, but worth it for quality
   - v2.0 note: Same sensors will work for advanced features

2. **Audio Output:** Start with passive buzzer + PWM
   - Reason: Simplest implementation for learning Phase 1 fundamentals
   - **v2.0 upgrade path:** ESP32 DAC ‚Üí PAM8403 amp ‚Üí speaker + line-out
   - Clear migration strategy in AudioEngine class

3. **Development Approach:** Virtual prototyping first
   - Reason: Validate logic before hardware assembly
   - Risk mitigation: Avoid damaging components during learning
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Wokwi simulation ready

4. **I2C Address Management:** XSHUT pin method
   - Reason: Simpler than multiplexer for 2 sensors
   - Implementation: Sequential initialization with address reassignment
   - v2.0 note: Will add MCP23017 expander, SSD1306 display on same bus

### v2.0 Strategic Decisions
5. **Modular Architecture:** Separate classes for each subsystem
   - Reason: Easier to add v2.0 features without rewriting
   - **Benefit:** Can test SensorManager, AudioEngine independently
   - Future: Easy to add Oscillator, EffectsChain, DisplayManager classes

6. **Incremental Feature Addition:** Checkpoints after each phase
   - Reason: Monitor CPU/RAM usage before adding more features
   - Critical checkpoints: After Phase 2 (1 osc), Phase 3 (2-3 osc), Phase 4 (effects)
   - Plan B ready: Drop from 3 to 2 oscillators if CPU >80%

7. **Performance Budget:** Reserve CPU headroom
   - Target: <75% CPU usage sustained
   - Latency: <20ms sensor-to-sound
   - Audio dropout rate: 0 (critical)
   - See `/productbrief.md` Section 5 for detailed budgets

### Open Questions
- When to acquire Phase 2 components (DAC amp, speaker, OLED)?
- Which specific ESP32 board variant (standard DevKit sufficient)?
- Physical layout: Sensor positioning for ergonomics?
- Enclosure design: Wait until Phase 6 or prototype earlier?
- MCP23017 vs direct GPIO: When to add expander?

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- Object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns
- Each class has single, well-defined responsibility
- Public interfaces documented with comments
- Meaningful class and method names (e.g., `SensorManager::getPitchDistance()`)
- Clean abstractions that hide implementation details
- Future-proof design allowing easy feature additions

### Development Philosophy
- Build incrementally: test each component before integration
- Fail gracefully: handle errors without crashing
- Debug visibility: comprehensive serial output during development
- Documentation first: understand requirements before coding

### Documentation Organization

- Clear initialization failure messages

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Architectural Insights

**Modular Design Benefits (Phase 1 Foundation Complete):**
Successfully refactored from monolithic code to modular architecture:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each class handles one aspect (input, output, coordination)
- **Testability**: Can test SensorManager without AudioEngine and vice versa
- **Extensibility**: Adding v2.0 features requires minimal changes to existing code
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and fix bugs in specific subsystems
- **Reusability**: Classes can be used in other ESP32 projects

**Class Design Pattern:**
The three-layer architecture works well:
1. **SensorManager** - Input abstraction layer
2. **AudioEngine** - Output abstraction layer
3. **Theremin** - Business logic / coordination layer

This mirrors MVC pattern and makes v2.0 expansion straightforward.

**v2.0 Extension Path (Planned Architecture):**
Adding new features is now clean:
- **Phase 2:** Oscillator class with wavetable generation ‚Üí Integrate into AudioEngine
- **Phase 2:** DisplayManager class for OLED ‚Üí Add to Theremin coordinator
- **Phase 3:** AudioMixer class ‚Üí Sum multiple Oscillator outputs in AudioEngine
- **Phase 3:** SwitchController class for MCP23017 ‚Üí Add to Theremin for user controls
- **Phase 4:** EffectsChain class (Delay, Chorus, Reverb) ‚Üí Insert between Oscillator and output
- **Phase 4:** LEDMeter class for WS2812B strips ‚Üí Add to Theremin for visual feedback

See `/productbrief.md` Section 4.4 for complete v2.0 class structure.

### Key Technical Insights

**I2C Multi-Device Challenge:**
Both VL53L0X sensors ship with identical I2C address (0x29). This is a common issue with I2C sensors. The XSHUT (shutdown) pin provides elegant solution:
1. Keep both sensors in shutdown
2. Enable first sensor, change its address to 0x30
3. Enable second sensor at default 0x29
4. Both now independently addressable

**PWM Audio Limitations:**
Passive buzzer with PWM provides only square wave. This means:
- Harsh, buzzy sound (not smooth like sine wave)
- Limited volume control (duty cycle has minimal effect on perceived loudness)
- Still adequate for demonstrating theremin concept
- Clear upgrade path exists (DAC + amplifier)

**Latency Considerations:**
Each VL53L0X reading takes ~20-30ms. With two sensors in sequence, that's ~50ms minimum loop time. This is acceptable for musical control (humans perceive latency >50-100ms as laggy). No optimization needed at this stage.

**Smoothing vs. Responsiveness Trade-off:**
Moving average filter (5 samples) provides stability but adds ~100ms latency (5 readings √ó 20ms each). This is acceptable trade-off for eliminating jitter. Can adjust SAMPLES constant if too sluggish.

### Development Strategy Insights

**Simulation Benefits:**
Wokwi allows testing without hardware:
- Validate I2C communication logic
- Test distance-to-frequency mapping
- Debug initialization sequence
- Build confidence before hardware investment

**Limitation:** If VL53L0X not available in Wokwi, HC-SR04 serves as functional equivalent for logic testing. Core concepts (read sensor ‚Üí map value ‚Üí generate audio) remain identical.

**Phased Approach Rationale:**
Don't attempt everything at once:
1. Single sensor + serial output = validate sensor reading
2. Single sensor + audio = validate audio generation
3. Dual sensors = solve I2C addressing
4. Full integration = combine all parts
5. Refinement = smoothing, calibration, optimization

This approach isolates problems and makes debugging tractable.

## Context for Next Session

When resuming work on this project:

1. **Read this activeContext.md first** - it contains current state
2. **Check progress.md** - see what's been completed
3. **Review systemPatterns.md** - understand architecture before coding
4. **Refer to techContext.md** - for library usage and configuration details

### Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] Verify PlatformIO is installed
- [ ] Verify Wokwi access (if using simulation)
- [ ] Check if hardware has been acquired
- [ ] Review which phase we're in (see progress.md)
- [ ] Check for any code files in project directory

### Key Files to Monitor
- `platformio.ini` - PlatformIO configuration (will be created)
- `src/main.cpp` - Main Arduino code (will be created)
- `diagram.json` - Wokwi circuit diagram (will be created if using Wokwi)
- `wokwi.toml` - Wokwi configuration (will be created if using Wokwi)

## Notes & Reminders

**Critical Path Items:**
- XSHUT initialization MUST happen before sensor.begin() calls
- Sensor addresses must be set in correct order (0x30 first, then 0x29)
- PWM channel must be set up before ledcWriteTone() calls
- Serial.begin() should be first line in setup() for debug output

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't confuse active vs. passive buzzers (need PASSIVE)
- Don't forget 100Œ© series resistor for buzzer protection
- Don't use delay() in tight loops (increases latency)
- Don't call ledcWriteTone() without ledcSetup() first
- Don't assume VL53L0X readings are instantaneous (they take time)

**Success Indicators:**
- Both sensors initialize without errors
- Serial output shows stable distance readings
- Frequency changes smoothly with hand movement
- Volume control works independently
- No I2C bus hangs or timeouts
- System runs continuously without crashing
