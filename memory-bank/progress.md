# Progress - ESP32 Theremin

> **üìå Roadmap Reference:**
> This progress tracker follows the v2.0 development roadmap (Phases 0-7).
> See `/productbrief.md` for complete feature specifications and phase details.

## Current Status

**Project Phase:** Phase 1 - Architecture Refactoring Complete ‚úÖ
**Overall Completion:** ~15% (Phase 0 + Phase 1 foundation complete)
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

### Status Summary
Major architectural refactoring completed! The project has evolved from a monolithic 250-line main.cpp into a clean, modular, object-oriented architecture with separate classes:
- **SensorManager** (header + implementation): Handles all sensor input (simulation and hardware)
- **AudioEngine** (header + implementation): Manages PWM audio synthesis
- **Theremin** (header + implementation): Coordinates sensors and audio

The Wokwi simulation environment is complete and functional. The refactored architecture is future-proof and ready for v2.0 features (DAC audio, multiple oscillators, effects, display, etc.).

**Current State:** Clean Phase 1 foundation ready. Next: Test in Wokwi, then proceed to Phase 2 (DAC + Amplifier upgrade)

## Known Issues

### Current Issues
None yet - no code has been implemented.

### Potential Issues to Watch For
1. **I2C Address Conflict**: Both VL53L0X sensors default to 0x29
   - Solution ready: XSHUT sequential initialization
   - Must implement carefully to avoid addressing errors

2. **Reading Jitter**: Raw sensor readings may be noisy
   - Solution ready: Moving average filter
   - Will need tuning based on actual behavior

3. **Latency**: Two sequential sensor reads = ~50ms minimum
   - Currently acceptable for musical control
   - Monitor during testing, optimize if needed

4. **Wokwi Limitations**: VL53L0X may not be available in simulator
   - Fallback: Use HC-SR04 for logic testing
   - Migration path: Test logic in Wokwi, then adapt to VL53L0X on hardware

5. **PWM Audio Quality**: Square wave will sound harsh
   - Expected and acceptable for this phase
   - Clear upgrade path to DAC exists

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Planning (October 15, 2025)

**Sensor Choice: VL53L0X vs. Alternatives**
- **Decision:** VL53L0X Time-of-Flight laser sensors
- **Reasoning:**
  - Precision: ¬±3% accuracy ideal for musical control
  - No interference: Two sensors can operate simultaneously
  - Speed: <30ms readings fast enough for real-time
  - I2C interface: Clean integration with ESP32
- **Rejected alternatives:**
  - HC-SR04 ultrasonic: Too slow, mutual interference likely
  - IR sensors: Too imprecise, ambient light sensitive
  - Capacitive: Too complex for educational project

**Audio Output: Buzzer vs. DAC**
- **Decision:** Start with passive buzzer + PWM
- **Reasoning:**
  - Simplicity: No additional audio circuitry required
  - Educational: Direct PWM control teaches fundamentals
  - Adequate: Good enough to demonstrate theremin concept
  - Upgradeable: Clear path to DAC + amplifier later
- **Trade-off accepted:** Lower audio quality in exchange for simplicity

**Development Strategy: Simulation-First**
- **Decision:** Use Wokwi for initial prototyping
- **Reasoning:**
  - Risk reduction: Test logic before hardware investment
  - Rapid iteration: Faster than physical breadboarding
  - Educational: See circuit and code together
  - Cost: Can validate approach before buying components
- **Limitation:** May need to adapt from simulated sensors to real VL53L0X
