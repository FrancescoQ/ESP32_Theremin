## Known Issues

### Current Issues

**Minor Pitch Stepping (Acceptable - October 27, 2025):**
- **Status:** âœ… Significantly improved, user-confirmed acceptable
- **Cause:** VL53L0X sensor returns integer millimeters (1mm = ~1.9 Hz steps)
- **Solution Implemented:** Exponential smoothing (EWMA with alpha=0.3) + float frequency mapping + sensor optimizations
- **Improvement:**
  - Smoothing: 65ms latency reduction (100ms â†’ 35ms), sub-Hz precision
  - Sensor timing: ~10ms latency reduction (85ms â†’ 75ms total)
- **User Feedback:** "Still a bit stepping, but I can live with it for now" â†’ "much nicer!" after sensor optimizations
- **Remaining:** Minor stepping still audible but acceptable for current phase
- **Future Work:** Non-blocking sensor API, predictive filtering, adaptive smoothing available if needed
- **Documentation:** See PITCH_SMOOTHING_IMPROVEMENTS.md for complete tuning guide

### Resolved Issues

**Audio Stepping/Choppy (RESOLVED - October 27, 2025):**
- âœ… Fixed with FreeRTOS audio task on Core 1
- Audio now perfectly smooth and continuous

**Pitch Stepping (IMPROVED - October 27, 2025):**
- âœ… Improved from ~1.9 Hz integer steps to sub-Hz precision
- Exponential smoothing + float mapping significantly reduced stepping

**Sensor Latency (OPTIMIZED - October 27, 2025):**
- âœ… Reduced total latency by ~10ms (85ms â†’ 75ms)
- High-speed timing budget: 20ms per sensor (vs 33ms default)
- Optimized reading architecture with updateReadings() caching
- User feedback: "much nicer!" - improved responsiveness confirmed
- Foundation laid for future non-blocking sensor implementation

### Potential Issues to Watch For
1. **I2C Address Conflict**: Both VL53L0X sensors default to 0x29
   - Solution ready: XSHUT sequential initialization
   - Must implement carefully to avoid addressing errors

2. **Reading Jitter**: Raw sensor readings may be noisy
   - Solution ready: Moving average filter
   - Will need tuning based on actual behavior

3. **Latency**: Two sequential sensor reads = ~50ms minimum
   - Currently acceptable for musical control
   - Monitor during testing, optimize if needed

4. **Wokwi Limitations**: VL53L0X may not be available in simulator
   - Fallback: Use HC-SR04 for logic testing
   - Migration path: Test logic in Wokwi, then adapt to VL53L0X on hardware

5. **PWM Audio Quality**: Square wave will sound harsh
   - Expected and acceptable for this phase
   - Clear upgrade path to DAC exists

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Planning (October 15, 2025)

**Sensor Choice: VL53L0X vs. Alternatives**
- **Decision:** VL53L0X Time-of-Flight laser sensors
- **Reasoning:**
  - Precision: Â±3% accuracy ideal for musical control
  - No interference: Two sensors can operate simultaneously
  - Speed: <30ms readings fast enough for real-time
  - I2C interface: Clean integration with ESP32
- **Rejected alternatives:**
  - HC-SR04 ultrasonic: Too slow, mutual interference likely
  - IR sensors: Too imprecise, ambient light sensitive
  - Capacitive: Too complex for educational project

**Audio Output: Buzzer vs. DAC**
- **Decision:** Start with passive buzzer + PWM
- **Reasoning:**
  - Simplicity: No additional audio circuitry required
  - Educational: Direct PWM control teaches fundamentals
  - Adequate: Good enough to demonstrate theremin concept
  - Upgradeable: Clear path to DAC + amplifier later
- **Trade-off accepted:** Lower audio quality in exchange for simplicity

**Development Strategy: Simulation-First**
- **Decision:** Use Wokwi for initial prototyping
- **Reasoning:**
  - Risk reduction: Test logic before hardware investment
  - Rapid iteration: Faster than physical breadboarding
  - Educational: See circuit and code together
  - Cost: Can validate approach before buying components
- **Limitation:** May need to adapt from simulated sensors to real VL53L0X
