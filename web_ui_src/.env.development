# WebSocket URL Configuration for Development
#
# This file shows how to configure the WebSocket URL when developing the UI locally.
# Copy this file to .env.local and update the IP address to match your ESP32 device.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.local.example .env.local
# 2. Update the IP address to match your ESP32
# 3. Run: npm run dev
# 4. Open: http://localhost:5173
#
# The UI will connect to your ESP32's WebSocket while running locally,
# allowing you to make UI changes without uploading to the device.

# WebSocket URL - Replace 192.168.1.100 with your ESP32's IP address
# IMPORTANT: Comment this out before building for production (npm run build)
# Uncomment only when developing locally (npm run dev)
VITE_WS_URL=ws://192.168.1.128/ws
