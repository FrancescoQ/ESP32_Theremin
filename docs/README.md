## üìù Documentation Conventions

### File Naming
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.md` for all documentation files
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group related docs in subdirectories

### Content Structure
Each documentation file should include:
1. **Title and brief description**
2. **Implementation date** (for improvement docs)
3. **Problem/Goal statement**
4. **Solution/Implementation details**
5. **Results and measurements**
6. **Related files and references**

### Cross-Referencing
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Reference code files explicitly
- Link to related documentation
